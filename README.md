# khamwan-dormitory
A sluggish, but working, dormitory website for old-school PHP learners.
This project is not really intended to be a replacement for all dormitory management systems, this is just a project for my website development lesson. All strings are written in Thai. You can make a request to translate this project to English if you really wanted this project.
